How long did this assignment take?
> 6 hours.

What was the hardest part?
> Database operations.

Did you learn anything new?
> I have worked with the modules I have used in here before. I managed to brush up my knowledge on some modules. 

Is there anything you would have liked to implement but didn't have the time to?
> I would have like to add unit tests.
> I would have like to integrate "lint" to maintain code quality.
> I would have liked to create an API which can be run as a Serverless API using AWS Lambda.

What are the security holes (if any) in your system? If there are any, how would you fix them?
> If I'm going to integrate "Companies" into the system and "Users" will be inside the Companies, I will change the way how all the users are retrieved. In such a scenario users will need to be retrieved based on the Companies because it's not good to show users of one company to a user from another company.

Do you feel that your skills were well tested?
> Yes.
